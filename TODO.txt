Routing:
- research on the web: good design for URL schemas ("best practices"), RESTful architecture, etc.
- look at source code of the routing classes (which is open source); especially the concrete implementation of the methods GetRouteData() and GetVirtualPath() of abstract class RouteBase (incoming/outgoing URLs, respectively)
